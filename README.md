## ü§ñ **Simple & Model-Based Agents**

*File Name:* **3) Agent(Simple, Model Based).ipynb**

In this notebook, we explore the foundational concepts of agents in **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on two primary types of agents:

- **Simple Reflex Agents:** These agents act based solely on current percepts, without memory of past states.
- **Model-Based Agents:** These agents enhance decision-making by considering historical data and previous states.

### Smart Home System Use Case

A practical example illustrates a **Smart Home System** where a camera detects an approaching individual and performs facial recognition. Recognized faces automatically unlock the door, while unrecognized ones alert the homeowner. The system also activates an alarm in case of forced entry and allows access via a PIN or physical key.

#### Agent Description

**Objective:** Secure access to the home by unlocking the door for recognized faces or valid PINs and locking it afterward.

#### List of Sensors

- **Motion Detector**
- **Camera**
- **Keypad**
- **Pressure Sensor**
- **Padlock**

#### Sensor Values

- **Motion:** {Detected, Not Detected}
- **Camera Status:** {ON, OFF}
- **Face Status:** {Recognized, Not Recognized}
- **PIN Entry Status:** {Correct, Incorrect}
- **Physical Key Status:** {Correct, Incorrect}
- **Owner Decision:** {Granted, Denied}

#### List of Actions

- **Camera ON**
- **Camera OFF**
- **Door ON**
- **Door OFF**
- **Alarm OFF**
- **Door Open**
- **Door Lock**

### Agent Functionality

The agent operates based on a perception-to-action model, dynamically responding to various inputs and situations to manage door access effectively.

### Agent Types Discussed

- **Table-Driven Agent:** Utilizes a predefined action table based on perceptions.
- **Simple Reflex Agent:** Responds directly to current percepts without considering history.
- **Model-Based Agent:** Makes informed decisions by incorporating past states.

### BFS Simulation

**Overview:**
- BFS reaches states by exploring nodes level by level, ensuring that no better path can be found once a state is reached.
- Early goal testing is employed as soon as a node is generated.

**Example:**
- **Start Node:** Arad
- **Goal Node:** Bucharest
- **Path Found

:** Arad -> Sibiu -> Fagaras -> Bucharest

### DFS Simulation

**Overview:**
- DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
- While it may not guarantee the shortest path, it is useful in certain scenarios.

**Example:**
- **Start Node:** Arad
- **Goal Node:** Bucharest
- **Path Found:** Arad -> Timisoara -> Lugoj -> Mehadia -> Drobeta -> Craiova -> Rimnicu -> Pitesti -> Bucharest

### Visual Representation

- **BFS Tree Representation:** Shows the order of node expansions.
- **DFS Tree Representation:** Displays how deep the search goes before backtracking.
