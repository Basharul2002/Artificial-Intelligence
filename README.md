## 🤖 **Simple & Model-Based Agents**

**File Name:** [3) Agent (Simple, Model-Based).ipynb](https://github.com/Basharul2002/AI/blob/main/3.%20Agent(Simple%2C%20Model%20Based).ipynb)

Delve into **AI agents** with a focus on simple reflex and model-based agents. This section features practical applications, such as a **Smart Home System** agent that manages access based on sensor inputs (e.g., face recognition and PIN entry).

### Use Case: Smart Home System
- **Objective:** Ensure home security by controlling door access through a series of inputs and actions.
  
### Key Concepts:
- **Sensors:** Motion detector, camera, keypad, and more.
- **Actions:** Lock/unlock door, turn alarm on/off, etc.

Explore how **Table-Driven**, **Simple Reflex**, and **Model-Based Agents** process this information.

## 🧬 **Genetic Algorithms**

**File Name:** [6) Genetic Algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/Basharul2002/AI/blob/main/6.%20Genetic%20Algorithm.ipynb)

This notebook covers the fundamentals of **Genetic Algorithms**, a type of optimization technique inspired by evolution. 

### Key Concepts:
1. **Population:** Collection of potential solutions.
2. **Fitness Function:** Measures how well a solution solves the problem.
3. **Selection, Crossover, Mutation:** Mimicking natural processes to evolve better solutions.

Follow along with an example problem to see how a genetic algorithm refines solutions over multiple generations.
